# Pizza_restaurant

This website was made as a univesity project with two of my colleagues. The website contains a presentation page, a menu page and a contact page.
I mainly worked on the contact page and the PHP script behind it. The script takes the data that the user inputs on the contact page, sends it to an email and displays a confirmation or warning message for the user.

NOTE: The SMTP server is not sent so the email is not actually sent
