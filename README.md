# Pizza_restaurant

This website was made as a univesity project with two of my colleagues using UIkit. The website contains a home page, a menu page and a contact page.
I mainly worked on the home page and the PHP script behind the contact page. The script takes the data that the user inputs on the contact page, sends it to an email and displays a confirmation or warning message for the user.

NOTE: The SMTP server is not set so the email is not actually sent
